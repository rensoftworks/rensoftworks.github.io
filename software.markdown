# Miscellaneous

## Slang

*Slang* is a custom data serialization and configuration language, focusing on simple, editor-friendly syntax. It was developed for Song of Eterna, mostly out of frustration with JSON and lack of good alternatives in Godot. **Fun fact:** this site is styled like a Slang document.

I've finally finished writing up the bulk of the code necessary to run this site- mostly templating and CSS. Frontend web development sucks- did you guys know that? I've tried to keep the markup sane enough, at least.

With that being said, I'm very happy to finally be able to compose proper blog posts. I have a few planned- first, a retrospective on my Slow Jam game, WARPOUT (which can be played [here](https://rensoftworks.itch.io/warpout)); this should be coming out soon after the jam's showcase event. Following that, I'm planning a special announcement for an upcoming project. Until then, stay tuned!
